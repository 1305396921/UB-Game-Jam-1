This is the first game I made for 2025 UB Game Development Club's Game Jam event. 

The name is called Glorp Adventure because the theme is glorp and the game must have reveresed element of regular games. 

For my game, I reveresed the control of movement from AD to JL and by pressing J you are going to move right instead of left and same idea for L.

Instead of SPACE for jumping, you jump by pressing the LeftShift.

You are welcome to download it and check out the funny elements in the game :)
